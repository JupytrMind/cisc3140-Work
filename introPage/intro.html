            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Richard Jackson, and I am a Senior at Brooklyn College.
                I am currently studying Information Systems and have a keen interest in cybersecurity and system implementation.
                I am a member of various technology organizations such as Black Girls Hack, ISACA, and Professor Roger's Cyber Lounge.
                I am also a mentor with the Technology Leadership and Development Program at Barugh College.
                My interests include exploring new technologies, trying new resturants, watching anime, and enjoying nature.
